# LMC-LLVM-Target
Little Man Computer (LMC) is an incredibly simple instruction set, used for teaching, that gives a model of a computer
in the Von Neumann Architecture. This program provides a compiler front-end to translate LLVM's IR to LMC. So, in
theory, any language compilable to IR can be compiled to LMC; e.g., C.
